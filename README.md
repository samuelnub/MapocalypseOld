# Mapocalypse

An old web-based javascript game-let that lets you move a small pawn across the google maps world - a slightly more fleshed out standalone version can be found at [Mapocalypse](https://github.com/samuelnub/Mapocalypse)

It's not currently under development and may (does indeed) have bugs - but there's a cool custom "console" div that you can move around!
