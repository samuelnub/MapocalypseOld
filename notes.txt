    hello!
    by the way, i love the function(){}.bind(this) method of binding the
    "this" context
    compiling: browserify ./src/main.js -o index.js
    TODO: help command, doh (maybe get event listeners)

    refactoring
    saving/loading works !!
    you can now do things to your outputted console lines with the callback,
    which returns the p element (the gamedata save() is an example)

    use IconMouseEvent to extract place data from a clicked place
    (not too sure about getting the icon though)
    oh no, claiming the console just multiplies the onEnter event listeners,
    it's a fork bomb but crappier

    SUBROUTINES!
    by the way, console.error is cool cause you get the function traceback
