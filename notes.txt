    hello!
    by the way, i love the function(){}.bind(this) method of binding the
    "this" context
    compiling: browserify ./src/main.js -o index.js
    TODO: help command, doh (maybe get event listeners)

    refactoring
    saving/loading works !!
    you can now do things to your outputted console lines with the callback,
    which returns the p element (the gamedata save() is an example)

    use IconMouseEvent to extract place data from a clicked place
    (not too sure about getting the icon though)
    oh no, claiming the console just multiplies the onEnter event listeners,
    it's a fork bomb but crappier

    SUBROUTINES!
    by the way, console.error is cool cause you get the function traceback
    FYI https://developers.google.com/places/supported_types for place types
    ayy, calculating the distance of long and latitudes:
    https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html
    places rate limits are per session!! that may be a good thing

    entities/entity/player class start, also more work into gamemap class

15 Nov 2017
    oH my GOD, there's object literal GETTERS, AAAAA
    you can now grab anything that's in your object, WITHIN THE OBJECT
    huh, circular dependancies aren't too big of an issue here... unlike cpp
    some work on entities and map

19 Nov 2017
    mapContextMenu prototype works
    
25 Nov 2017
    sliding map marker library added (first dependency lmao)
    http://techslides.com/demos/country-capitals.json is prety developers
    types of water (also a natural_feature):
    sea, ocean, bay, lake, river, reservoir
    seedrandom also added as dependency

    Doing it in free study!

    naw, what will an entity need? 
    BaseEntity() {
        type: number
        marker: Marker instance
        stats: {...}

        // functions it should have
        onTick(callback) // your entity should implement this
        move(latLng)
        export()

    }

    Entities are now BaseEntities, and stuff like Player are now called
    "entity"
    Also, you now create a baseentity by doing new BaseEntity(), so you've
    got intellisense suggestions lol

17 Dec 2017
    You can now determine whether it's land or water!!1

19 Dec 2017
    baseEntity is back to entity, and now things like the player class
    are now player managers and are "static"
    can spawn a new player..!!!

20 Dec 2017
    player can mOOOOvEEeeE (might want to move the function for moving
    over to the PlayerManager class...)

21 Dec 2017
    So here's the flow:
    user clicks "travel here" or does an action
    player begins moving
    entities.tick() executed, looping over all entities to carry out logic
    player finishes moving animation

23 Dec 2017
    you can now load a game, start load [savedata]
    game can finish now, with a coolio "congratulations" message
    upcoming: possibly "actions" which manifests themselves as context menu options,
    and will cause modifications to the entity's stats (like moving - changes position
    and also stamina etc);
